# FrontEndDev2020
This is my working repository for all code louisville languages I will be learning. I wanted this to be a working resume, something i could edit and add to going forward as I learn new languages.

For my first course, I have 4 requirements per the project guidelines:
1. I have a navigation menu of sorts that is responsive. All clickable links will redirect besides LinkedIn as this is to be created at a later time. Once the screen size is scaled down, the links then move to a new line in their container.

2. In my styles.css file, I used :first-child & :last-child to give the line items in the navigation a margin of zero in my media query.

3. I researched how to add animation to a webpage and made my images fade in as the page loads.

4. In my javascript, i have created a function to run a dialog box once a user clicks submit on my feedback form, this function then will display back to the user in a dialog box "Thank you (name) for your feedback". I also have a javascript function that calculates how many seconds are in a week and displays in the console a message.
